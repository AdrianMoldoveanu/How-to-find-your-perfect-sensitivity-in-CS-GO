        <ul>
            <li>Gaming mouse-measure your hand size,set your grip style(big hands will favour a palm grip while small to medium will favour claw or fingertip grip) then choose your gaming mouse</li>
            <li>Mousepad- opt for a medium to large mousepad as having more tracking space is better</li>
            <li>Gaming monitor- nowadays there are budget friendly options but anything with a clear image, refresh rate of 144Hz and a resolution of 1080p is more than enough</li>
            </ul>

            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Start by finding the sensitivity at which you can do a single 360 degrees rotation on your mousepad, starting from the far left edge and going to the far right edge.
            </li>
            <li>
                After you find the 360 sensitivity move left to right and then from right to left trying to track the bullet hole.If you overtrack lower it and if you undertrack increase it.Spend at least 3-5 minutes with each sensitivity.

            </li>
            <li>
                After you track the bullet hole comfortably and your crosshair stays on the target while you move, you have found your tracking sensitivity.
            </li>
            <li>
                After you are happy with your mouse sensitivity <em>do not change it</em>. You ll develop muscle memory and your flicking sensitivity will adjust in time as well.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Congrats! You are one step closer in becoming one of the great. Do not forget: great aim comes with time. Goodluck!</strong>
